  /*
    Flashcard Summary:
   -----------------------
    Problem: Make the string k-special:
      |freq(i) - freq(j)| <= k for all characters.
   
    Example:
      word = "aabcaba", k = 0 â†’ Output: 3
    Strategy:
     - Count the frequency of each character.
     - Try every non-zero frequency as the *minimum base frequency*.
     - Delete all characters lower than base.
     - For characters higher than base + k, delete the excess.
     - Track minimum total deletions.

    Time Complexity: O(26^2) = O(1) â†’ because alphabet is fixed
    Space Complexity: O(26) â†’ constant for character count
    Handles large word sizes efficiently.
